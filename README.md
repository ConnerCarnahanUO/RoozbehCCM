# CCM
Methods for simulating neural data and computing causality and prediction of time series data based on convergent cross mapping.

This is a derivative version of Amin Nejat's code found here: https://github.com/amin-nejat/FCF/tree/object_oriented

# Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/ConnerCarnahanUO/RoozbehCCM.git

cd RoozbehCCM
conda create --name fcf python=3.11
conda activate fcf
pip install -r ./requirements.txt

```
If you want your environment to have a different name just replace "fcf" with whatever you want in the above code.

## Barebones lab usage guide

1. Generate the FIRA file from the recorded neural data and copy the file path to the FIRA file
2. Change the following 2 strings to the file path of the new data
   a. In RoozbehProject/Basic_FIRA.yaml "rest_path"
   b. In RoozbehProject/dataparams.yaml "path"
3. In RoozbehProject/dataparams.yaml change the value of "out_path" to the location you want to save the output in. WARNING: DO NOT MAKE THIS NESTED (like output/folder1/folder2/) IT WILL BE UNABLE TO SAVE UNLESS YOU HAVE ALREADY CREATED THE EMPTY FILEPATH ON YOUR OWN.
4. Open the anaconda prompt and navigate to the directory of this folder.
5. Run the following commands on linux:
```
conda activate fcf
python RuneCCMSearch.py
```

or if on windows:

```
conda activate fcf
python RuneCCMSearch_Windows.py
```

6. After completion there will be files generated in your output folder. The one with the Node Hub rankings is "hub_rankings.csv" which has the channels listed in descending order of hubness with their hubness values

Things to consider: 

This code is explicityly designed to skip things already computed in the output folder. So if you want to recompute anything with different parameters you should give a different output folder in the 3rd step.

The time this will take is highly dependent on a bunch of different 

## RuneCCMSearch.py

This file is designed to determine the hub channels and significant connections of a set of Time Series.

### Workflow

Step 1:

The program takes an input file and converts it into a numpy array that extended Functional Causal Flow (eFCF) will actually be calculated on. How this is done is defined in the "data_loader.py" file. If it is already a time series stored in a numpy array, the "data_type" parameter should be set to "Numpy". FIRA files are also supported, but require a little more:

0. Open "dataparams.yaml" in with any text editor you want (nano, vs code, whatever is easiest)
1. set data_type to FIRA.
2. set path to the location of the FIRA file
3. generate a config file for the FIRA file, this was implemented by Amin and for our purposes the only things that matter are the paths to the unstimulated data set and (rest file) and fs, which sets the binning time for spike counting. (There is a "Basic FIRA.yaml" file that you can use as a template)
4. Set conig_path to the path of the config file you just made
5. set out_path to the folder you want to use for the output data, make sure that if the directory is not created yet that you either do that or only have the path set to one level out from where you already have a folder (ie currentfolders/Newfolder is okay but currentfolders/Newfolder1/Newfolder2 will throw an error)
6. (optional) Set any of the FCF computation parameters that you want, these are outlined in the following section, for now it is best to just have it set to not do pvalues and only compute hubs so that it won't take forever.
7. in the terminal navigate to the RoozbehCCM folder use the following commands:

conda activate fcf
python RuneCCMSearch.py

8. The outputs are in the folder you designated for the output. The rankings of hub channels is in the "hub_rankings.csv" file.

Step 2a:

The program will compute the best delay that should be used for the total delay embedding, this will be the fastest part of the program but it's significance to the data isn't really known (to us at least) right now.

Step 2b:

The eFCF tensor is computed on the input data set for a (semi-)arbitrary delay dimension. This give an approximation of the "optimum" set of values. The tentitive hub nodes are then found by finding the sum of eFCF values over the set of afferents (hubness). There will be a print statement that gives the ranking of each channel. In an experimental setup, to a good approximation, these will be the channels that should be stimulated for a maximum effect over all other channels and if you want to start working with the stimulation of the monkey neurons as quickly as possible these are what you will want to use.

Step 2c:

The significance of each connection will be computed for a fraction of the channels (defined in "dataparams.yaml") which have the greatest hubness using the twin surrogate procedure. When this is finished computing it will tell you which connections between channels and hubnodes should experience an effect. This will be a very long step with the current implementation, but will probably get better over the time as I update the implementation.

Step 3 (Dimension Search):

This will also take forever. Each connection has an "optimum dimension" that we believe is the best dimension to compute the eFCF for. As we do not have a complete theory for this data set we basically just have to search over all dimensions until we find what we think is best. So this really is just a really long parameter search that you should let run while you are working with the monkey.

Done.

### Parameter Files

There are two parameter files that define how the computation is done "initparams.yaml" and "dataparams.yaml". They are stored in "yaml" files since they are pretty common and have the most natural syntax (to me at least).

1. "initparams.yaml"
num_cpus , int: the max number of processes that the program will take up during the computation, this should always be less than the number of cpu cores that the computer being used has so that you don't get any terrible problems when it has run out of available cpus.
num_gpus , int: Currently unused but will define how many available gpus there are when we I implement gpu usage
max_memory , int: Currently does nothing but was used for bug finding when everything was constantly crashing

2. "dataparams.yaml"
data_type , string: Tells the program how the data should be loaded based on the file type, currently only supports "FIRA" and "numpy"
path , string: The file path where the data currently is
config_path , string: Where the configuration file is for data loading. Depending on the data type there are parameters that are required to bin data and make sure everything is loaded properly. I will have an explanation of all the required fields for FIRA files but if you look at the example configs file it should be fairly explanitory.

d_min , int: the minimum dimension used for the parameter search

d_max , int: The dimension that will first be computed and is the maximum for the parameter search.

delay , int: The delay used for embedding, if set to 0 it will find the best one using a Mutual Information method (maybe I'll explain this later but it's currently not necessary)

low_lag , int: The minimum lag of causality to be computed for each pair, this should always be <= 0

high_lag , int: The maximum lag of causality to be computed for each pair, this should always be >= 0

lag_step , int: The number of steps over the lags that will be computed, this is useful if the data is very slowly varying over time since many lags will be redundant to compute

In general you don't want to compute that many lags, and for our data you should keep them pretty close to 0, but if you go out passed +- 10 then just adjust the step size so that fewer lags are computed on.

kfolds , int: The number of cross validation sections that will be computed on. This should be >= 2, with 5 being what I recommend. This is required for noisy data since the noise generaly gets averaged out.

n_surrogates , int: The number of surrogates generated for the twin surrogate significance test
node_ratio , float: The ratio of channels that will be considered for hub compuations, this should be 0 <= node_ratio <= 1. With what I have currently computed on previous datasets it looks like about 20-26% of connections are significant with pval <= 0.01 so for speed considerations it makes sense to have this ratio around .2

retain_test_set , bool: Whether we should make sure the test set of the eFCF computation is maintained in the twin surrogate test, this is so the data is not corrupted by the fact we have messed up our test set / switched information between partitions.

normal_pval , bool: Whether we should assume that the surrogate eFCFs are normally distributed. This is very useful for keeping the computation length down since we can use far fewer surrogates to approximate how significant each connection is.

pval_threshold , float: The maximum p-value we should consider when determining whether a connection is significant. If any connection is > this value we will ignore it for the parameter search.

min_pairs , int: The minimum number of pairs we want to include in the parameter search. This overrides the pval_threshold and will sucessively increase the threshold until we satisfy significant pairs > min_pairs. Basically this is a check so that we didn't use too low of a threshold and the new threshold will be saved.

early_stop , bool: Whether in the dimension parameter search we should remove a computation when we obtain the same optimum repeatedly when computing the eFCF in the parameter search (this will reduce computation time)
